# Contrinuting to Acteur-rs

Thanks for your interest in helping out! ðŸ™Œ ðŸ˜„

Let me first describe what are the most difficult challenges Acteur faces:

## Soundness

Acteur should be safe. That means, not loosing messages and not repeating messages inside of the same machine. There should be at maximun only one Actors-ID instance.

Any help analyzing the current algorithm and proposing changes to it would be great!

## Easy to use

The API is not big, but certainly takes a bit to get use to it. Ideas of how to evolve the API, merge methods, new concepts, etc are very welcome.

## Internal structure

Right now there is some duplicated code between Actors and Services. It isn't the end of the world, still, is something to try to fix eventually. At the same time, any idea about the internal structure is welcome too.

## Anything else

Feel free to propose and speak any idea wish you have.

# About the code of conduct

Read the code of coduct. I will apply it.

For the rest, I hope we can build an awesome piece of technology that, at least, helps people to learn Rust and about Actors. ðŸ˜„
